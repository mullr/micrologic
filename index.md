# micro-logic

A literate Clojure implementation of microKanren. Read the annotated
source at http://mullr.github.io/micrologic/literate.html.  This is
largely based on microKanren, an even more minimalistic version of
miniKanren.  For more information, see the bibliography at the bottom
of the above document.
